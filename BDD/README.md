### Self Documentation and Tagging components
These BDD tests have the ability to self document in the [components documentation](https://github.com/18F/cg-compliance/tree/master/data/components).

In order to create a self documenting a tag in the format below should be placed above a test scenario.
`@Component-"Name of the test"-"System Key"-"Component_Key"`
example:
```
Feature: Audit and Accountability

@Component-LOG_TESTS-CloudFoundry-CloudController
Scenario: Content of Audit Records
  Given I am using a master account
    when I look at the audit logs
    then audit logs have timestamp
    And audit logs have type of event
    And audit logs have actor
    And audit logs have actee
```

When the test scenario runs a new verification will appear in the component.
example:
```yaml
verifications:
  LOG_TESTS:
    last_run: 2016-01-22 13:55:03.305097
    name: Audit and Accountability Content of Audit Records
    path: 'Feature: Audit and Accountability Scenario: Content of Audit Records'
    type: TEST
```

These verification can be added to specific control to prove that the information system's control requirements are satisfied.
```yaml
satisfies:
  NIST-800-53:

  AU-3:
    implementation_status: null
    narrative: 'Cloud Foundry stores detailed events which can be accessed through
      the CF API. A list the events is available in the API documentation.
      '
    references:
    - verification: LOG_TESTS
```
